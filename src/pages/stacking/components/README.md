# Components

The components in this folder are related to one another and meant to be used in a particular way.

`stacking-form-step.tsx`: These are layout components that help present inputs to the user, as well as their description. Each input can be seen as a "step" needed to be completed before a form can be submitted. They may be all visible in the UI at the same time or used in a guided "wizard". They're meant to be used in the context of a stacking-related form.
